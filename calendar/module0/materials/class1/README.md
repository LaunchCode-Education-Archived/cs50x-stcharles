# Class 1

### Before Class
Get excited!

### During Class
Today is the first day of class! Although you've already begun learning, we want to officially introduce you to the class, and the systems we'll be using. Some of this will be administrative (yawn), but it's all important stuff. The rest of the time will be office hours for you to begin the [Prep for Class 2](../class2-prep).
